# Digital Art Jams
This website is intended to be used Northeastern's Digital Illustration Association (DIA) to host weekly/monthly Art Challenges. Club members can sign up for an account in order to participate in/submit their artwork for the challenges.
This website will record all previous, current, and future challenges. For each challenge, it will collect submissions and create galleries, resulting in a collection of galleries of student-submitted artwork.
